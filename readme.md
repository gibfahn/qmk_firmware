# GibDox Keyboard layout

### How to flash

- Install the prerequisites from [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/getting_started_build_tools.html).
- Run for each hand (with the right hand plugged in directly, and the keyboard
  in flash mode):

```bash
make ergodox_infinity:gib:dfu-util # Left hand
make ergodox_infinity:gib:dfu-util MASTER=right # Right hand
```

Keep a paperclip handy in case you brick your device (can't get it into reset
mode to flash new firmware), in which case you want to hit the reset buttons on
the bottom of each half.

#### More than one DFU device found

If you hit this error:

```
dfu-util: Invalid DFU suffix signature
dfu-util: A valid DFU suffix will be required in a future dfu-util release!!!
dfu-util: More than one DFU capable USB device found! Try `--list' and specify the serial number or disconnect all but one device
```

Try `dfu-util -l`, and see what the other device is. In my case I had one called
`runtime`. The workaround is to run `make` with the keyboard plugged in but not
in flash mode. When you see execution halt on these lines:

```
dfu-util: error detaching
Resetting USB...
```

then put the keyboard into flash mode. This works reliably for me.
